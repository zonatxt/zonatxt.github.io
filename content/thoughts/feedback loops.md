## Tight feedback Loops

[Source: Beware of tight feedback loops by _Brian Lui_](https://brianlui.dog/2020/05/10/beware-of-tight-feedback-loops/)

"Focusing on tight feedback also leads to getting stuck in local maxima. The short turnaround time leads to the pursuit of incremental improvements. Accurate feedback reduces error, but this means reaching and staying at the local maximum. The more accurate and more rapid the loop, the more quickly you’ll arrive at the top of the hill – and the less chance you have of leaving it to climb the mountains of mastery."

"This is because feedback loops which are too short for the overall system makes people focus on inappropriate intermediate goals."
