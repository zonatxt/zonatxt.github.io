## Theory

We produce a lot of data (see: [[thoughts/Data Capitalism|data capitalism]])

- [[thoughts/data mining|Data mining]]: automatically extract useful knowledge from large datasets
- Machine learning: automatically detect patterns in data and use these to make predictions or decisions
  - Typically, AI $\subset$ ML $\subset$ Deep Learning
- Typically, data mining is more human-in-the-loop and more application specific whereas machine learning is more hands-off and general
- Both similar to statistics but more emphasis on larger datasets, predictions instead of descriptions, and more general models

Healthy skepticism is good though:
