Potential exploration on my gripes with existing [[thoughts/tools for thought|tools for thought]] using principles from [[thoughts/Rhizome Proposal|Rhizome]]. Extracted from my [[thoughts/idea list|idea list]]

- Transclusion of blocks supported by default
- Full revision history with the granularity of single operations
- Write first, organize later: always-on 'default note'
  - Make it super easy to split out content into a new note
  * Good daily notes, choose what to carry over from the previous day

* Block based editors are neat, it allows more drafting/moving stuff around really easily
  - If you drag outside the page it makes a new note, super easy to break down big complex topics into more granular/atomic notes
  - Spatially consistent? [Memory palace](thoughts/memory%20palace.md) vibes -> https://twitter.com/jordanmoore/status/1418942880941477891
* Card based backlinks/outgoing links
  - On the left, you can see all the notes that link to the current page
  - On the right, you can see all outgoing links
  - Hovering on each card will reveal another layer which those ones are connected to
* Timeline view
  - each note will come with a date so you can chronologically order notes and view them that way (kind of like a [[thoughts/git|git]] history) if you brain works better that way
* Good global search (see: [[thoughts/information retrieval]])
* [Interoperability](thoughts/interoperability.md) of data, easy export
