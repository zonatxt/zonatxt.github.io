> How to produce/pronounce sounds or signs, how we hear sounds

## Sounds

- Phones: different sounds a language uses
- Phonemes: meaningfully different sounds in a given language
- Allophones: phones that do not differentiate meaning
- Phonotactic knowledge: knowledge of constraints on the sequencing of sounds
- Phonological idioms: words the child produces in a very adultlike way, while still incorrectly producing other words that use the very same sounds

## Variations in phonetics

- Voicing: whether vocal folds vibrate (e.g. /s/ is voiceless, /z/ is voiced)
- Place of articulation: where the vocal tract is closed
- Manner of articulation: how the vocal tract is closed
  - Stops: completely stop the airflow
  - Fricative: not completely stopped
- Articulatory phonetics: describing speech sounds in terms of how they are produced
- Phonetic features: axes of different features for sounds (e.g. voicing, place of articulation, etc.)
