The ant who traces a line that ends up looking like a caricature of Winston Churchill. Is it a picture or [[thoughts/representation]] of him?

Resemblance is not necessary nor sufficient for representation

- not sufficient → A can resemble B even if it fails to represent B
- not necessary → A can represent B even if A fails to resemble B

Do we need [[thoughts/intentionality]]?

Words and pictures aren't inherently _about_ something, that meaning is added via our own attitudes. What _does_ matter for representation is some sort of [[thoughts/causality|causal]] link back to the [original thing](thoughts/originality.md).
