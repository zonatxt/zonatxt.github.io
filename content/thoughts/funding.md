> Raising funding is just purchasing time to be together

## Bounty Model

Paying people set amounts for set tasks.

Bounty model is tough because

1. Immediate shared context is required and onboarding new members to do novel work is hard (upfront costs are large)
2. Keeping people engaged after the tasks are difficult (no long term sense of investment)

How can we keep individuals engaged with a project on longer term timescales?

1. Encouraging individuals to create projects with the technology/ideas
2. Through hiring (contractually bound commitment)

## Grants

Funding individuals/projects/organizations without the expectation of stake. Can be one-time or recurring.

What are the [incentives](thoughts/incentives.md) for people to provide grants then? Within [web3](thoughts/web3.md), a lot of the reason is because of the obsession with profit. Donating to OSS is thereby a way to improve the long term return on their profit/investment. Is this still possible to incentivize grants when the technology/idea itself is not inherently of value (i.e. maybe only has derivative value)?
