> A _collection_ is a group of resources that have been selected for some purpose.

- Resource-type: a novel, biography, etc. (ordering on the type of artefact)
- Resource-kind: coin collection, stamp collection, etc. (ordering on the medium of artefact)

A collection itself can also be a resource. An index is a description resource that contains information about the location and frequencies of terms in a collection to enable more efficient search.

What then is a [library](thoughts/library.md)? According to Glushko, they are [organizing systems](thoughts/organizing%20system.md) which "select, collect, organize, conserve, preserve, and provide access to information on behalf of a community of users."
