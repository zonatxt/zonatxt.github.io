Reduction is a relationship between theories.

## Microreduction

Microreduction is a specific subset of reduction that focuses on explaining the macro using the micro ([emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md))

This is the opposite of [[thoughts/downward causation]]

### Mind-brain Reductionism

A successful neuroscience would show how to reduce statements about mental properties ([qualia](thoughts/qualia.md)) to statements about neural properties (actual neural activity).

### Functionalism

An alternate to this is functionalism, wherein a successful neuroscience would show how to reduce statements about mental properties to statements about functional properties (an abstraction to apply this to other potentially non-human conscious minds -- e.g. AI)
