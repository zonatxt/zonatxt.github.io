DAOs give us structured ways to [collect](https://foundation.app/blog/pleasrdao), [invest](https://metacartel.xyz/), and [build](https://raidguild.org/) together.

Inherently transparent, every aspect of the org is public. The most infamous DAO, [The DAO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)>), was a decentralized VC fund. Eventually raised $150M but had $60M hacked, leaving a negative impression/skepticism around DAOs for a while.

All members can still be anonymous and built reputations attached to their [pseudonym](thoughts/pseudonymity.md) rather than real [[thoughts/identity|identity]], hopefully helps to create a more even playing field

## Potential Issues

- How does this work for people who want to keep things under NDA/keep IP safe?
- Not everything can be codified, what happens in vaugely defined/legal gray zones?
- Often times no legal protections outside the rules governed by the smart contracts facilitating the DAO
- [Tragedy of the Commons](thoughts/tragedy%20of%20the%20commons.md): how do we ensure all members of the DAO have stake and participate?
- How/can we enforce who joins a DAO? Would this lead to lower quality discussion and higher noise due to lack of [value alignment](thoughts/value%20setting.md) and [group limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md)?
