Maybe chaos is necessary for [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md). Thus, lossy communication in low [bandwidth](thoughts/bandwidth.md) communication helps seed for selection/mutation of new ideas. Examples of this include [[thoughts/writing|writing]].

When we write, we flatten the cloud of associated ideas in our head into a linearized subset (lossy). The reader then unflattens this linearized subset into their own cloud of associated ideas (lossy). Each lossy step is an opportunity for **mutations** in understanding to emerge.
