> Small Technology is everyday tools for everyday people designed to increase human welfare, not corporate profits.

Principles of small technology:

1. easy to use
2. personal
3. [[thoughts/privacy|private]] by default
4. share alike
5. [[thoughts/peer-to-peer]]
6. [[thoughts/interoperability|interoperable]]
7. zero knowledge
8. non-commercial
9. non-[[thoughts/colonial debt|colonial]]
10. inclusive

Thoughts: not sure I agree with how they say that the small web is single-tenant. Collaboration is important! We use the web not because its easy to own our stuff, but because it should be easy to do stuff with others.
