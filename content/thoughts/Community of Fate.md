[Margaret Levi in Noema Magazine](https://www.noemamag.com/an-expanded-community-of-fate/)

> The keystone is generating an “expanded [[thoughts/communities|community]] of fate.” For societies to survive and thrive, a significant proportion of their members must engage in reciprocal altruism

"Our goal is a form of farsighted reciprocal altruism in which members are willing to make costly sacrifices on behalf of those with whom they believe their fates, and their descendants’ fates, are entwined but who may never be able to directly reciprocate." -- reminds me a lot of [Bentoism](thoughts/Bentoism.md), specifically the 'future us' square

A lot of very similar values to Unions and [mutual aid](thoughts/Mutual%20Aid.md), e.g. "An injury to one is an injury to all."

Heresthetics: using rhetoric, storytelling and strategy to redefine the situation in a way that changes the choices for a significant proportion of the populace (see also: [[thoughts/fiction]])
