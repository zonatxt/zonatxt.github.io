1. Slippery Slope: conclusion based on the premise that if A happens, then B, C, ..., X, Y, Z will happen too. So A means Z will happen. But in reality, none of the steps logically entail each other.
2. Hasty Generalization: conclusion based on insufficient or biased evidence
3. Post hoc ergo propter hoc: conclusion that if A occurred after B, then B must have caused A
4. Genetic fallacy: conclusion that the origins of a person, idea, institute, or theory determines its nature, character, or worth
5. Begging the claim: circular conclusion where the result is validated in the claim
6. Circular argument: restates the argument rather than proving it
7. Either/or (false dichotomy): oversimplifying an argument by reducing it to two sides or choices
8. Ad hominem: attack on the character of a person rather than their opinions or arguments
9. Ad populum: eoptional appeal to speak to positive/negative concepts rather than the real issue at hand (e.g. if you were a _true_ x)
10. Red herring: diversionary tactic that avoids key issues by diverting it to another argument
11. Straw man: oversimplifies an opposing viewpoint and attacks weakened argument
