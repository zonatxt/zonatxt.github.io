I always dislike introductions because it feels like applying [labels](thoughts/quantization.md) to things too early. People have expectations (oh so you're an artist? show me your work). Both self-imposed and not!

And can open the door to unhealthy [[thoughts/idolization]]. As a side note, this is the same reason why calling yourself a writer vs someone who writes are two very different vibes (i _dabble_)

And of course, it's first of many experiences, why do we feel the need to get it right at the start? When people are prompted, *“describe yourself”*, shouldn’t we be a little alarmed when they routinely describe something else? People who [introduce](thoughts/introductions.md) themselves by talking about their job make me feel really weird. You're just describing the means you take the keep yourself alive -- what are the ends? What makes you _feel_ alive?

## Intersectional Identities

> "A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups" -- Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)

Cooley imagined affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining one's individuality and identity more accurately.

"These 'reciprocally constructing phenomena' that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression."

"It strikes me that these labels are more often conversation enders than conversation starters, attempts to reduce a vast complexity into a neat, little word, with the lossiest of compression algorithms."

We cheer for the clothes, not the people. As Feynman said, "honors is epaulets, honors is uniforms"

## Increasingly online

Will we ever get to a point where introductions become useless because we already know everything about each other? What about pre-stalking people on social media before meeting them? Is this just people projecting their identities?
