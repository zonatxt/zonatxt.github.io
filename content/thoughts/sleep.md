> "We tend to wear our ability to get by on little sleep as some sort of badge of honor that validates our work ethic. But what it really is is a profound failure of self-respect and of priorities. What could possibly be more important than your health and your sanity, from which all else springs?" [Source](https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/23/13-learnings-13-years)

"Sleep is the parentheses of your day; decide how much you need (I recommend 6-8), then be religious about getting that exact amount." ([On how to be a creative person with a job](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/on-how-to-be-a-creative-person-with-a-job/))
