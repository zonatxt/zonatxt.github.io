In [[thoughts/supervised learning|supervised learning]], we have features $x_i$ and class labels $y_i$. Write a program that produces $y_i$ form $x_i$

In **unsupervised learning**, we only have $x_i$ values, but no explicit target labels. We can

- [[thoughts/outlier detection|Outlier detection]]: is this a normal $x_i$?
- Similarity/[[thoughts/clustering|Clustering]]: which examples look like this $x_i$
- Which $x_i$ occur together
- Latent-factors: what 'parts' are the $x_i$ made from
- Data visualization: what does the high-dimension $X$ feature space look like?
- Ranking: what are the most important $x_i$?
