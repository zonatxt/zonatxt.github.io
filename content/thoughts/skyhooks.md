We should have nondystopian science [fiction](thoughts/fiction.md) -- there's value in reclaiming an optimistic and hopeful future. I love the concept of skyhooks: dream about what you can build as if the sky had hooks you could hang your creations from (a metaphor for unlimited resources) and most of the time, you can still create that with scarce resources.

Steve Grand in _Creation: Life and How to Make It_

> If an architect believes for a moment that there are hooks in the sky to hang his creations from, he may be able to conceive of structures that he would otherwise not dare to think about. Once the design starts to take shape, he may then begin to see ways in which the essence of it can still be achieved without the need for sky-hooks at all. Maybe this will work for us, too.
