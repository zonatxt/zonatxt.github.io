Content only has meaning if it has context. Content thus must be empty of independent origination (it cannot exist on its own, see also: [[thoughts/emptiness]]).

## Context in writing

Footnotes and marginalia are layers of context on top of the original media. These annotations situate the original media in new contexts.

## Context of data

For most data in web2, the application _is the context_. How do we make data as first class citizens?

Does [[thoughts/interoperability|interoperable]] data mean context-free data? I don't think so. I think [[thoughts/interoperability|interoperable]] data is data that can be _translated_ across contexts

## Context on the web

In relation to the [Internet](thoughts/Internet.md): our browsing is also very static and in a small window. By default, you can only browse on a page-level scale. What about subdomains? Apex domains (see more in [DNS](thoughts/DNS.md))? How do we expand the aperture of the web browser to encompass more [information scales](thoughts/information%20scales.md)? (potential [idea](thoughts/idea%20list.md))
