Forming a belief based on the [trust](thoughts/trust.md) of another's written or spoken word.

Three main positions of validity of knowledge gained through testimony

1. Skepticism (e.g. John Locke): one cannot gain knowledge on the basis of testimony alone. Cannot ensure reliability of other actors
2. [Reductionism](thoughts/Reductionism.md): one can gain knowledge through testimony, but only if one has independent, inductive reason for believing that the speaker is reliable
3. Non-reductionism (e.g. [Nyāya](thoughts/Nyāya.md)): one can gain knowledge through testimony simply by trusting the speaker (provided that the speaker knows what they assert). Testimony is a trust-worthy [epistemic](thoughts/epistemology.md) instrument, knowledge is communal

## Testimonial Injustice

Two main kinds of testimonial injustice

- Receiving more credibility than they otherwise would have (credibility excess)
- Receiving less credibility than they otherwise would have (credibility deficit)
  - E.g. speaker's accent -- indicating certain educational/class/regional background
  - Although can be beneficial in some cases, see the [[thoughts/Jestermaxxing]]
- Specifically, this is in the context of the _knower_ being wrongly judged in their capacity to be accurate
  - Injustice means it must be harmful but also wrongful
  - Injustice also carries a connotation of [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md) to it: it is very hard to believe that one who accidentally misjudges another is committing an injustice against someone (personal belief of Fricker here)

Two modifiers for testimonial injustice

- Persistent: repeated frequently, for example when the injustices occur in the context of their professional life
- Systematic: centered within a system of [power](thoughts/power.md), fundamental to the predominant social, economic, or political practice
