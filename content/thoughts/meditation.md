## A Cognitive Science Approach

- Focused Attention
  - Directing attention towards an object (e.g. breathing)
  - Detecting mind wandering/distractions
  - Disengagement of attention from distractors
  - Leads to effortless sustained attention and ability to monitor attention and notice mind-wandering
  - [Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15936259/) showing that focussed attention led to extreme increases in perceptual dominance both during and after meditation
- Open Awareness
  - No explicit focus on objects
  - Nonreactive
  - Leads to acute awareness of phenomenal qualities of experience without ‘grasping’ (approach/avoidance).
