Stream interfaces like Discord and Slack basically create a single global timeline that moves at a certain rate. If you miss a certain conversation, it flows away.

Someone once described Slack as the online version of the open office arrangement -- it puts the pressure of everything being visible all the time to everybody on the individual.

We do "gardening" in our tools for thought but it's not exactly social first. Sure, we can leave messages for each other but this is not communication. It's more like background cueing/prompting.

How can we create mangroves? Garden/forest type ecosystems which have gently flowing multi-branched stream systems, designed for [digital mindfulness](thoughts/digital%20mindfulness.md) and non-linearity?

Can we create different [pace layers](thoughts/pace%20layers.md) for interaction?
