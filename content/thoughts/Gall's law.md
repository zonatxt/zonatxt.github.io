## Gall's Law

A rule of thumb for [[thoughts/complexity|complex]] system design: simple alphabets produce complex behaviors, complex alphabets produce stupid behaviors

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system\*\*

## Gall-Meadows Ladder

Adewale Oshineye coins the concept of a Gall-Meadows ladder

> Success needs what I think of as a Gall-Meadows ladder: a mechanism for jumping from one stable system to another ... in order to evolve your project
>
> The Gall-Meadows ladder suggests that to get from a simple working system to a complex working system you have to find a sequence of working systems that increase the level of complexity.
