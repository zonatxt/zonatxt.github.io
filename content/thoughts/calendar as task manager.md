Most task management falls into three categories

1. Task managers: To organize the things we need to get done
2. Email: To communicate with others
3. Calendars: To manage our time

However, these are all just ways of expressing 'events' in some calendar; emails are just tasks and tasks are just calendar events.

In fact, most of todayâ€™s email clients are built around the concept of Inbox Zero, which effectively turns your email inbox into a todo list with public write access.
