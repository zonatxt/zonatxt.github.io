An **affordance** signifies _what_ action is possible. It is the relationship between the properties of an objects and the capabilities of the user that determine how the object could be used. For example, a chair affords ("is for") support and therefore affords sitting. If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required.

An object's affordances are never equally perceptible to all, and never equally available to all.
