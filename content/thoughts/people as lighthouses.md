## Community Care

Lighthouses are beacons for ships at night, identifying the shoreline when everyone else in the town is sleeping.

What happens when the lighthouse stops working? Do the ships crash against the shoreline, oblivious to the jagged rocks beneath the waves?

No, the community comes out at night to light their lamps and bonfires. What was once a singular beacon of light is now a coast awash in light! Ideally, this is what community care -- supporting the beacons of our communities until they are well again.

A goal of life is harmony with others, to see people and understand them, make people feel heard.
