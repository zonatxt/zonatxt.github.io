There’s a timeless saying “garbage in, garbage out” in the field of Computer Science which essentially states that bad data or bad input will produce an output that’s of equal quality. This holds true for almost all the tech we use today, from trading algorithms to search results. If what we put into the system is inherently unclear or flawed, then the output will also give back something that’s ‘wrong’ or doesn’t align with our objectives.
