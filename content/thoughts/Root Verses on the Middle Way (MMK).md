_by Nāgārjuna_

A key text in [Buddhist](thoughts/Buddhism.md) religious texts. Use of reductio ad absurdum (proof by contradiction) to show how all phenomena exhibit [emptiness](thoughts/emptiness.md).

Nāgārjuna is a [phenomenologist](thoughts/phenomenology.md).

Within it, heavy use of the tetralemma form of argument that is composed of 4 forks

1. Affirmation: $X$
2. Negation: $\lnot X$
3. Both: $X \land \lnot X$
4. Neither: $\varnothing$

Objection posed that [emptiness](thoughts/emptiness.md) is nihilistic and would lead to the non-existend of the Four Noble Truths, Three Jewels, and Buddha. Yet, Nāgārjuna shows this not to be the case.

> "Like a poisonous snake when held incorrectly or a magic spell when improperly used, emptiness, when incorrectly understood, devastates the simple minded"
