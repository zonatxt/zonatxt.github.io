A double bind is a psychological predicament in which a person receives from a single source conflicting messages that allow no appropriate response to be made

- If a pilot is deemed insane, they don't have to fly.
- To be deemed insane, a pilot must request to be evaluated.

- Therefore, no pilot can ever be deemed insane, and no pilot can get out of flying.

Thus, there is no way to win.
