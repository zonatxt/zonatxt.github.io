Summarization of the [Kademlia paper](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf)

> A [[thoughts/peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer]] distributed hash table ([[thoughts/DHT|DHT]])

Participating computers each have a node ID in the 160-bit key space. Key-value pairs are stored on nodes with IDs "close" to the key for some notion of closeness. A node-ID-based routing algorithm lets anyone efficiently locate servers near any given target key

A `get(key)` operation traverses the identifier space and, upon hitting a node storing key, returns the keyâ€™s corresponding contact list. Then, the requesting node can contact these nodes, in parallel or in some application-specific way, to download the stored data.

Core ideas

- Uniform ID Space: names for both data and nodes share the same ID space
  - But collisions are ok as they mean different things depending on the context
- Decide what machine to place data on depending on a measure of 'closeness' between the name of the data and name of a machine
  - Euclidean distance can be ambiguous, two entries could have the same distance
  - XOR distance between $x$ and some arbitrary $y$ will _always_ be unique
- Each node only needs information about its neighbours.
  - If the structure of the network is correctly chosen, then global properties apply to the whole network
  - Nested routing similar to [[thoughts/IP Address|IP]] routing
  - Each machine has a lot of info about machines closest to it, less about machines far away from it

## Security

- It is very vulnerable to Sybil attacks, which can result in the modification or erasure of any data in the network.
- It also uses no message encryption whatsoever
