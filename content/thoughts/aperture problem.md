A problem in [computer vision](thoughts/computer%20vision.md) that arises when there is limited spatial [[thoughts/context]].

- Without distinct features to track, the true visual motion is ambiguous
- Locally, one can compute only the component of the visual motion in the direction perpendicular to the contour
