A **Byzantine fault** is any fault presenting different symptoms to different observers.

A **Byzantine failure** is the loss of a system service due to a Byzantine fault in systems that require [consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) between nodes.

Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the property of a system that is able to resist the class of failures derived from the [[thoughts/fault tolerance#Byzantine Generals Problem|Byzantine Generalsâ€™ Problem]]. This means that a BFT system is able to continue operating even if some of the nodes fail or act maliciously.
