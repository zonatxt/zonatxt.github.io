> Better HCI is better empathy

What even is HCI?

- The human-machine joint performance of tasks
- Human-computer or human-human communication mediated by computers

Many a clever invention has been termed ‘before its time’ because the inventor did not see how to build a transition from what was known and in use to what was new.

3 main goals of HCI

1. Designing
2. Implementing
3. Evaluating

As designers, we are **defining systems**, and implementing the structures that **create culture**. We have the responsibility to think about the world as a complicated, ethically fraught place. We are [designing interactions](thoughts/interaction%20design.md)

_Always ask:_ who are my users, and what are their needs?
