> Cease to do evil; try to do good

## Four Noble Truths

1. Dukkha (Suffering) is an innate characteristic of existence
2. Samudaya (Origin/Cause) of suffering is tanhā (craving) and fundamental ignorance. We believe we are a separate, [independent existence](thoughts/emptiness.md)
3. Nirodha (Cessation) of suffering comes from letting go of this tanhā
4. Magga (The path) leading to nirodha
