> A network that is layered on top of another network

Normally on top of [[thoughts/HTTP]]. Fun fact! The [[thoughts/Internet]] was originally built as an overlay upon the telephone network

Examples:

- [[thoughts/VPN]]
  - [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)
- [OpenZiti](https://docs.openziti.io/#build-a-network)
- [ZeroTier](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) (or the open source version [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale/))
- Almost all [[thoughts/peer-to-peer]] [[thoughts/distributed systems]]
  - Most notably, [[thoughts/DHT|DHTs]]
