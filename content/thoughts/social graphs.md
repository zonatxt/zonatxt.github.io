> Social graph: who's connected to who

How do social graphs work if users are [pseudonymous](thoughts/pseudonymity.md)? If [cities are not top-down hierarchies](thoughts/A%20City%20is%20not%20a%20Tree.md), then are social graphs a better way to think about them?

Does directness matter in social graphs? i.e. Facebook is undirected (friend means you are friends with each other) whereas Twitter is directed (you can follow someone but doesn't mean they follow you back)

## Social Graph vs Interest Graphs

Interest graph: online representations of interests

- Some social media construct social graphs from interests (e.g. TikTok)
- Some social media construct interest graphs from social graphs (e.g. traditional networks like Facebook)
