> Our goal as economic designers is to craft the systems that drive our selected set of values.

Economics is predominantly concerned with the central Economic Problem, namely

- **Limited resources**: There are limited resources in the world;
- **Unlimited needs**: Greedy humans have essentially unlimited needs for those resources.

However, assumptions in the early economic models of human behaviour are problematic:

1. Homo economicus: The most common behavioral model assumes that humans are atomic individuals who operate rationally and selfishly.  We know now that humans have limited attention, are contextually altruistic, are highly [[thoughts/tribe flourishing|tribalistic]], and exhibit a wide range of irrational cognitive biases.
2. Individuals are the best judge of their needs: Our brains are not conscious of the base psychological processes driving some of our most pressing needs and are thus unable to value relationships rationally.
3. Weak social modeling: Most economics models ignore basic human behavior such as friendship networks, affiliation networks, limits on cognitive resources (ex: attention) or altruism.

Economics embraces reductive [[thoughts/Utilitarianism|utilitarianism]] and posits you can put a price on anything. We tend to be intrinsically motivated to connect to others and invest long term in a relationship where no extrinsic value is ever publicly admitted. When a relationship transitions into being an extrinsically rewarded transactional relationship, the relationship often suffers a catastrophic loss of value.

### Selfishness

[Source: Does Studying Economics Breed Greed? by _Adam Grant_](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/give-and-take/201310/does-studying-economics-breed-greed)

Those that practice economics — and to a degree modern American capitalism — are heavily invested in an implicit system of [self-centered](thoughts/selfish.md) moral values.

"The repetitive doctrine that humans are best modeled as selfish rational optimizers creates a set of selfish social norms that practitioners consciously or subconsciously follow. The act of studying economics makes you a morally worse human-being (by most definitions of morality.)"

How do we move beyond the study of scarcity and towards a study of abundance and [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md) goods?
