In ordinary scenarios, we maximize expected [[thoughts/utility|utility]] (EU Max). However in precautionary scenarios, we want to avoid catastrophic harm (Precautionary Principle)

## Tripod Framework

Manson's Framework for when to use the precautionary principle

1. Serious damage (damage condition): some outcomes exceed a threshold of badness and are considered catastrophic
   - Thresholds for levels of harm: serious, catastrophic, irreversible, civilization collapse
   - Thresholds for time scales: present, pre-2100 (current population), post-2100 (future generations)
   - Scope: local, global
2. Uncertainty (knowledge condition): some outcomes meet a required threshold of evidence to count as a serious threat
   - Probability: possible, non-negligible probability, predicted by a model, predicted by a well-understood scientific mechanism
3. Proportional remedy: response should correspond to the plausibility and severity of the threat
   - Prohibition/ban, further research, moratorium, mitigation/restriction

However, could potentially lead to irrational outcomes or outcomes that are contradictory. e.g.

1. Greenhouse gases (GHG) may cause catastrophic temperature rise ⇒ Ban GHG at once
2. Banning GHG may lead to economic crisis, world war and nuclear holocaust ⇒ Don’t ban GHG

## Versions of PP

1. If the activity meets the damage condition, and
2. If the link between the e-activity and the e-effect meets the knowledge condition,
3. Then apply the e-remedy.

_But,_ PP versions must be internally consistent; it cannot ban its own remedies

### Catastrophe Principle

If an effect is catastrophic, and there is a possible link between the activity and the effect, then the remedy is to ban the activity completely.

For example, ban nukes because their possible use has a catastrophic effect
