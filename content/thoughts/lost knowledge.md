> What if other objects like the Antikythera Mechanism have already been discovered and [[thoughts/forgetting|forgotten]]? There may well be documented evidence of such finds somewhere in the world, in the vast archives of human research, scholarly and otherwise, but simply no way to search for them. Until now.

Undiscovered public knowledge: coined by Don Swanson. A problem that occurs when researchers arrive at conclusions independently from one another, creating fragments of understanding that are “logically related but never retrieved, brought together, [or] interpreted,”

Are better tools for [collaborative thinking](posts/collaborative-thinking.md) with [networked thought](posts/networked-thought.md) potential ways to counteract this? What about [[thoughts/digital permanence|digital permanence]]? How do we effectively [[thoughts/search|search]] for information?

> "The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed. There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene."
