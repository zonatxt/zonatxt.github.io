> Towards real-time read-write [[thoughts/hypertext|hypertext]]

TLDR; a simpler and more understandable form of [[thoughts/CRDT#Operation-based|CvRDT]] that relies on a strong notion of happens-before [[thoughts/causality|causal relationships]] and unique identifiers.

- The objective is to automate information dissemination the way hyperlink automated associations and search engines automated search.
- Speculatively, as people become more and more densely connected, they are more and more aware of each otherâ€™s details. As a consequence, communications naturally gravitate to compact and speedy update-only forms
- Causal Trees
  - A tree of atoms. Atoms are triples of `(id, causing_id, letter)`.
    - Any set of changes can be represented as a set of atom removals and insertions.
    - Atom removals are represented by a special "backspace" atom
    - `id` is generated in the form of a owner UUID and a Lamport timestamp
  - An atom's `id` is always greater than its `causing_id`. This defines a partial [[thoughts/Order theory|order]]
    - Thus, the tree is a causality tree where each causing atom acts as a parent to its caused atoms
    - Atoms are stored in append-only causality feeds. Every feed complies with that order: the causing atom always precedes any of its caused atoms
  - Inserts happen directly to the right of its `causing_id` (or parent)
  - A yarn is a full contiguous sequence of operations at a node
- Merging feeds: sort by `id`
  - This is actually called a weave, which contains every piece of the file to ever exist as well as all the special characters (e.g. backspace)
  - Note that backspace only marks an atom as _inactive_, it is never actually removed
    - This "backspace" atom has high priority so always hugs its parent in the resulting weave
  - Recovering the plaintext version of the weave is constructed by removing inactive atoms from the weave.

Anyone writing something based on causal trees only needs to define two functions:

1. Reducers: inserts arbitrary atoms into an ordered log
2. Mapper: traverses the structured log to arrive at a state
