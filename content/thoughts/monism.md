Monism holds that ultimate reality is _all of one kind and one kind only_.

More familiar forms of monism:

- [[thoughts/idealism|Idealism]]
- [[thoughts/Materialism|Materialism]]

## Neutral Monism

The intrinsic nature of ultimate reality is neither mental nor physical (between idealism and materialism)

Much like interiors and exteriors, in Russel's account the mental and physical imply and necessitate each other as reflection of a single (hence monistic) nature
