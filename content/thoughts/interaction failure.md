Interacting with interfaces is complex, and often poorly designed. Most times,

1. The tasks are implicit and complex: the machine doesn't "know" the user's end goal
2. Interaction is unpredictable and complex: coordination between human and machine is complicated, usage can be unexpected and evolved, users can change their minds

### Interfaces

1. Functionality Problem: what are the functions this object can perform? Will it do what I want?
2. Visibility Problem: what mode is this object in? What sequence of controls do I use to get what I want?
3. Negative Transfer: what would happen if I do what I usually do?

### Designers

Can fail to

1. understand the range of users and their limitations
2. understand contexts of use
3. communicate what it does, how it works/worked, etc.
4. start with basic usability needs, and might try to make it exciting or beautiful first

### Market Pressures

User's don't always make good purchase choices

1. Adding new functionality is relatively easy and cheap whereas adding effective controls/feedback is expensive and costly for time and space
2. Designer time is expensive
3. Some consumers value cost or looks over usability
