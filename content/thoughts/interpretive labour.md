## Interpretive Labour

Source: [Research Debt in _Distill Pub_](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt)

There is a tradeoff between energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand it. This energy differential is called 'interpretive labour'

Most research is one-to-many, where there are a lot more people trying to understand a subject than explaining it. As a result, the quality of explanations have an **outsized impact** for the better.

Cost of understanding increases when there are more source to try to understand. This may be why people specialize so that there is less noise. Related: [group limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md)
