How do we motivate people? Is [money](thoughts/money.md) effective as an incentive?

How do we prevent the [tragedy of the commons](thoughts/tragedy%20of%20the%20commons.md), help fund [public goods](thoughts/public%20goods.md), and incentivize [maintenance](thoughts/maintenance.md)?

In all honesty, I think that the only way to incentivize things is to pull at what intrinsically motivates them and to make what they do feel like [play](thoughts/play.md). Create spaces of local abundance for people to feel comfortable trying new things and enable [tribe flourishing](thoughts/tribe%20flourishing.md)

### Libertarian Paternalism

The goal of encouraging the design of [organizing systems](thoughts/organizing%20system.md) and policies that maintain or increase freedom of choice but which at the same time influence people to make choices that they would judge as good ones
