_by Ã‰douard Glissant_

A beautiful dialogue between Glissand and the curator Hans Ulrish Obrist.

> I still believe that the future lies not with the great powers, but with the little islands, lands, and cities.

## Globality versus Globalization

- Globality does not homogenize culture. It produces a difference from which new things can emerge. (22)
- Globalization standardizes and dilutes. It reduces communities to a single model, attacking them from the top down, diminishing them.

## Archipelagos

- "a world of many worlds" as quoted by the Chiapas
  - they desire a _creole_ -- a mixed Mexico
- Creolization is the means by which several distinct cultures or their elements, come into contact in a particular place in the world ([contact languages](thoughts/contact%20language.md) enable this)
- Distinction between multiethnic (where many cultures exist but are distinct) and creole (where many cultures mix and form new ones)

[Digital gardening](posts/digital-gardening.md) and [networked thought](posts/networked-thought.md) as tending to free isles? The reader is a free [[thoughts/agency|agent]]. This freedom produces chance, it produces the unexpected.

## On [utopias](thoughts/utopia.md)

> Utopia is what is missing to us in the world -- and thus it is never complete

- If we imagine utopia as a finished work, then we're continuing the old debates, we're continuing the old science, and we're continuing the old demands.
  - Why we need to continue to write new shared [fiction](thoughts/fiction.md)
- Utopias cannot have norms. When we have norms, we banish to hell anything that does not fall within the rule of that utopia.
- To reach utopia, we must accept that our world changes radically and perpetually, and that it changes with us and in us. We should reject stasis and and immutable.

> Utopia is a feeling: an ability to sense that all is entangled
