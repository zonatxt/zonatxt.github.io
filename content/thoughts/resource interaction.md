Interactions arise naturally from the affordances of resources or are purposefully designed into [organizing systems](thoughts/organizing%20system.md). Intersects with [interaction design](thoughts/interaction%20design.md)

The most common interactions are

1. Accessing resources
2. Merging resources

Distinguishing interactions means looking at user requirements, resource properties used, and the legal, social and organizational environment.

To enable interactions, it is necessary to identify, describe, and sometimes transform resources.

One approach to resource transformation is to use a _crosswalk_ or [[thoughts/boundary object]] which are equivalence tables that relate resources from one organizing system to another

Another is to use _data mapping_, in which descriptions layers are compared and matched using either unidirectional or bidirectional links. This allows us to bridge the vocabulary problem in which different people refer to the same concepts slightly differently.

As for evaluation criteria, generally the most important aspects are

1. Efficiency (timeliness and cost)
2. Effectiveness (accuracy and relevance of results)
3. Satisfaction (user sentiment)
