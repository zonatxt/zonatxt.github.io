## Human Exchange

On the basis of human exchange: we only have a relationship with the other (as equals) when the exchange is incomplete, i.e. when there is debt.

> Someone will give you something and the expectation is that you will give them something in return, though not something of _exactly the same_ value as that would indicate you no longer wish to relate with them

By this definition then, a community is one where everybody is a _little bit_ in debt to everyone else which gives us an excuse to continue seeing each other.

Money then, appears to be a way to have quantified and transferable promises. (An aside, why do we even feel the need to [quantify](thoughts/quantization.md) promises??)

However, **the philosophy of debt as something which cannot be forgiven only ever crops up in situations of structural coercion and extreme inequality.**

## Against the Econ 101 argument

Barter → money → credit is not only wrong, it's backwards.

We have never found any evidence for an entirely barter-based society. In places without money, there are usually rough credit systems instead: "a cow is roughly like a canoe is roughly like a good necklace". Of course, people can shirk this but your reputation is then tarnished and that can be social suicide in small communities.

## Markets and Government

Traditionally, free markets and governments have been seen as opposing principles.

Historically, in fact, markets tend to be created _by_ governments as a side-effect of military operations and to fund armies.
