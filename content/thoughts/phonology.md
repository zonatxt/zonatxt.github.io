> Which sounds are used in language, how sounds are combined to form words

## Phonological processes

- Systematic ways in which to alter the sounds of the target language so that they fit within the repertoire of sounds they can produce
- Canonical form: preexisting whole-word sound pattern (e.g. consonant + vowel + /j/ + vowel + consonant)
- Articulatory complexity: types of sounds (or sound sequences) that lead individuals with articulatory deficits to make errors

## Listening

- Functional load: importance of certain features in making distinctions
- Phonological awareness: awareness of and ability to work with sounds in spoken language
- Phonological memory: the ability to remember a sequence of unfamiliar sounds
- Speech segmentation problem: how do children find word boundaries in a stream of speech
