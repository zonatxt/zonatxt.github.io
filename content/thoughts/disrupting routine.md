From _[The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/2021/02/08/the-ants-and-the-pheromones/)_

The ‘reward equation’ models how ants communicate using pheromones, and our own brains keep track of rewards using dopamine. The reward equation includes a decay or ‘forgetting’ parameter, so what happens if you disrupt established solutions for long enough that their hold is broken?

**If you disrupt all of the pheromone trails around their nest, is that they converge on a new solution in the environment, but it won’t necessarily look the same as the one they had before the disruption**
