Kierkegaard's instructional advice in his _Journals_ (from [In Over Our Heads](thoughts/In%20Over%20Our%20Heads.md))

> "If real success is to attend the effort to bring a person to a definite position, one must first of all take pains to find him where he is and begin there. This is the secret of helping others... In order to help another effectively I must understand what he understands. If I do not know that, my greater understanding will be of no help to him... Instruction begins when you put yourself in his place so that you may understand what he understand and in the way he understands"
