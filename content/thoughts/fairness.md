## On Algorithmic decision making

[Source: Can you make AI fairer than a judge? Play our courtroom algorithm game in _MIT Technology Review_](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/17/75285/ai-fairer-than-judge-criminal-risk-assessment-algorithm/amp/)

No matter how much data we collect, two people who look the same to the algorithm can always end up making different choices.

Two definitions of fairness:

1. keep the error rates comparable between groups, and
2. treat people with the same risk scores in the same way.

Both of these definitions are totally defensible! But satisfying both at the same time is impossible.
