Developed at XEROX PARC in the late 1990s and was inspired by biomimicry (specifically, animal behaviour theories)

|        | Animal Foraging                                              | Information Foraging                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal   | Food                                                         | Information                                                     |
| Patch  | Site containing one or more potential sources for food       | A source of information (e.g. website)                          |
| Forage | Search for food                                              | Search for information                                          |
| Scent  | How likely a patch will provide food                         | How promising a source of information appear to user            |
| Diet   | Totality of food types that can satisfy hunger for an animal | Totality of information sources that a user may consider useful |

**Rate of gain = Information value / Cost associated with obtaining that information (both actual time/effort and opportunity cost)**

[Bounded rationality is at play here](thoughts/rationality.md)

Obviously we don't have perfect estimation for 1) how much information a patch contains and 2) how much time it will take to extract that information. This is where info scent comes in.

Things that contribute to scent:

1. Perceived credibility
2. Information density
3. Length

### Enrichment

Techniques, tools, and interactions, that maximize the utility of the information foraging. This can happen either between patches or within patches.

**But**, a good user experience involves web pages that are designed so that the user can get the maximum relevant information in the minimum amount of time.

Behaviour enrichments

- avoiding context switching ([page parking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/multi-tab-page-parking/): opening multiple pages in rapid-fire succession to save them for later)
- avoid reading the entire page but still getting the majority of information ([F-pattern scanning](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/))
- typically ignoring banners and the right rail

Interaction enrichments

- critically thinking about specific keywords for query
- use of within-page search (ctrl-f) to quickly locate content
