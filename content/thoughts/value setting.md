> "I’ve noticed that many people compete in games they don’t understand because they are modeling the behavior of people around them. Most common is the competition for wealth as a proxy for happiness." —Michael Seibel

Took on a large number of commitments in the past year, not everything was something I enjoyed. Been thinking about what makes work enjoyable

Ask yourself, and listen closely to your answer: “What do I like about this world? What pains me about this world?” Spend time developing your [[thoughts/taste]] for what is beautiful, as well as your sensitivity to what is discordant, unjust, ugly, wrong.

> Aim to be fulfilled—not excessively rich. There's a reason why lottery winners are just as miserable as they were before. Hedonistic adaptation is inescapable.
