> Emptiness is not nothingness. Emptiness is form.

Emptiness is like the mathematical concept of 0.

- It seems to have no value, yet is it the foundation of mathematics.
- Without 0, you cannot have 1, 2, 3, so forth.

Emptiness thus does not mean nothingness (0 is not null), emptiness is the base case through which existence is meaningful.

> In order for a glass to even be empty, it should first and foremost be there.

Emptiness means empty of independent existence -- all things are [interdependent](thoughts/interdependence.md). Thus, form is emptiness but emptiness is form (existence is to depend on others). This is sometimes referred to as dependent origination.

## Indra's Net

[Source: Indra's net on _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net)

Imagine a net stretching out infinitely in all directions with a monadic-like jewel at each node that reflects every one, including itself. These objects are nodes in a net of [[thoughts/ontology|ontological]] interdependence, one in all and all in one.
