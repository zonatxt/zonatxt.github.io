## Definition overloading

I think my worry with a 'standard library' is that there is no one 'unified' interpretation of a single concept, how will it adapt to usage overtime? Wouldn't this anchor thought patterns to a shared '[[thoughts/truth]]' and prevent evolution of language?

"By changing what we were, you change what we are and what we are going to be."

Erasure through terminology change, is this essentially just cooptation?

"Thus potential sources of uncertainty and misunderstanding arise in the form of homonyms (i.e. words that are used to denote more than one concept) and synonyms (i.e. more than one word for the same concept)."
