Information Systems are processes that organize people, technology, and data to allow people to create, store, manipulate, distribute, and access information.

Why build the ARPANET (precursor to the [Internet](thoughts/Internet.md))?

1. Explore the area of computer networking research (how to share computing resources)
2. Sharing resources for research communites (e.g. datasets)
3. Scaling past the speed of the phoneline (2.4kb/s)
4. Utility for command and control of various military sites (military-industrial complex)

#### Qualities of information systems

1. Accuracy: how accurate and truthful is data in the system?
2. Reliability: how many dependencies does it need? How often do those fail?
3. Learnability: how many skills do you need to acquire to use it?
