The more efficiently energy has been used, the **more**, not less, total energy has been consumed. This apparent paradox was first noted by economist William Stanley Jevons in 1856, in his book _The Coal Question_.

People were using the new, efficient -- and thus less expensive -- things to do many more things than they had been using the old, inefficient - and thus more expensive -- things to do.
