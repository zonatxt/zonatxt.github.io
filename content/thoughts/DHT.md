> The big hash table in the sky

One solution for 'decentralized' registry of peers. Each node holds a small shard of the DHT, so the burden of participation isnâ€™t painful for any one agent. The DHT stores multiple redundant copies of each entry so that the information is available even when the author and a portion of the authorities are offline.

Any good implementation tries to answer 2 questions:

1. Which nodes take which part of the hash map
2. If a key is not on a node, how does it go and get it?

Keys are opaque, 160-bit quantities (e.g. an SHA-1 hash). Peers store data with similar IDs.

Joining a DHT requires knowledge about at least one member of the DHT (the bootstrap node)

Implementations include

- [[thoughts/Kademlia DHT|Kademlia DHT]]
- Chord DHT
- [[thoughts/Sloppy Hashing DHT]]
- [[thoughts/Theseus DHT|Theseus DHT]]

### Applications to Torrent Software

Old way was to use a tracker, you announce which file you are going to download to the tracker and the trackers sends back a list of peers. However, these trackers tend to go down easily (get sued)

DHT proves to be a more reliable way of replicating this behaviour.

## Problems

- DHTs can be crawled and mined for profit
  - Perform a [[thoughts/Sybil Attack|Sybil attack]] by simulating 1000+ clients and just wait for values to come in, cheaply capturing 90%-99% of the DHT
- How do we make DHTs work where member count is low?
