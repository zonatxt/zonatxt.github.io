We spend so much time thinking about how to design cities we want to live in. Why don't we spend the same level of care thinking about how to design software we'd like to live in too?

A provocation: **what does it feel like to move into software?**

What if it was as easy to customize your software as it is to move furniture around your website. We can customize our homes so easily because you don't need full sets of furniture -- you can have an IKEA desk and Noguchi lamp. But with software, there are "ecosystems" that don't interoperate.
