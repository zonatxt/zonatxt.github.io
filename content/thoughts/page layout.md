Page layout is the art of manipulating a user's attention on a page to convey meaning, sequence, and point of interaction.

## Visual

Mechanisms

- Upper-left-corner preference
- Whitespace
- Contrasting fonts
  - the bigger and bolder, the more important the info
- Contrasting foreground and background colours
  - eg. putting white text on a black background
- Positioning, alignment, and indenting
  - indented text is subordinate to whatever's above it
- Graphics like lines, boxes, coloured bars
  - things in a box or group go together
- Flow
  - remember tendency to read top-to-bottom and left-to-right (at least, in the west)
  - **focal point:** spots your eyes can't resist going to
    - tend to follow them from strongest to weakest
    - better pages only have a few — having too many dilutes the importance
  - meaning and context play a big part in visual flow → perceived meaning of page content will change where the user chooses to look

## Placement

- **proximity:** put things close together, and viewers will associate them with one another
- **similarity:** if two things are the same shape, size, color, or orientation, then viewers will also associate them with each other
- **continuity:** our eyes want to see continuous lines and curves formed by the alignment of smaller elements
- **closure:** want to see simple closed forms, like rectangles and blobs of whitespace, that aren't explicitly drawn for us
