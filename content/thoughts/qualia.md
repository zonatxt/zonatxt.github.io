## Vibes

[Source: Nameless Feeling in _Real Life Mag_](https://reallifemag.com/nameless-feeling/)

[[thoughts/neural networks|Neural networks]] just assess vibes, they are the literal technical implementation of "no thoughts, just vibes".

Vibes are very similar to the approximations [machine learning systems](thoughts/machine%20learning.md) use. Both suffer from [Goodhart's Law](thoughts/Goodhart's%20Law.md)

On context-less data: Like vibes, these metrics carry no context or narrative; they can tell you nothing about how or why something might be desirable

Is [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md) derivative with vibes/qualia too?
