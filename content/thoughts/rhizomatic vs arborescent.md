## Arborescent

Hierarchical, tree-like networks.

Comes from the way genealogy trees are drawn: unidirectional progress, with no possible retroactivity and continuous binary cuts.

Whenever we have a tree structure, it means that within this structure no piece of any unit is ever connected to other units, except through the its parent (meaning the unit as a whole)

Does power always need to function top down?

> "The enormity of this restriction is difficult to grasp. It is a little as though the members of a family were not free to make friends outside the family, except when the family as a whole made a friendship."

The structure of a [[thoughts/blockchain|blockchain]] follows this very closely. See also: [[thoughts/semilattice]]

## Rhizomatic

> "a rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo." (Deleuze and Guattari in _A Thousand Plateaus_)

A nonlinear and non-hierarchical network with no specific entry or exit points. Defined as a _non-arborescent_ network.

Also what [[thoughts/Rhizome Proposal|Rhizome]] is named after.
