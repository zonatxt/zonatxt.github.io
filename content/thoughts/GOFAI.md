Historically, development of AI has been about systems that represent the world through symbols and manipulate those tokens in a systematic way to arrive at a result. Within these GOFAI systems, symbols are representative of aspects of our world. That is, it is a [[thoughts/symbolic system]]. This type of AI was coined Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI) by John Haugeland.

A very common example of GOFAI systems are expert systems, which are computer systems that emulate the decision making ability of a human expert. They solve problems via decision-tree reasoning, figuring out whether to perform certain actions based off of if-then rules.

At its core, GOFAI can be considered 'artificially intelligent' because of semantic interpretation. If the symbols represent aspects of our world, the result, which is also a symbol sequence, can be _translated_ back into aspects of our world. This is called semantic interpretation, which "seeks to construe a body of symbols so that what they mean ('say') turns out to be consistently reasonable and sensible, given the situation" (see [[thoughts/semantics]])

However, because of how symbols map to the world, GOFAI is very narrow-minded and vulnerable to unexpected variations and oddities in the problems and information they were given. That is, the [[thoughts/potemkin village]] that a GOFAI system may construct will hold up if only seen from the intended angles, but any slight deviation from an intended or expected input would shatter the illusion immediately.
