Nietzsche [saw the link between walking and creativity](https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/12/nietzsche-walking/). “There is nothing more revealing than to see a thinking person walking,” [wrote Thomas Bernhard](https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/06/25/thomas-bernhard-walking/), “just as there is nothing more revealing than to see a walking person thinking.” A passionate walker herself, Rebecca Solnit has defined the act as [“a state in which the mind, the body, and the world are aligned.”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/06/03/wanderlust-rebecca-solnit-walking/)
