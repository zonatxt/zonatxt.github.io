## Right to be forgotten

[Denegri Case](https://restofworld.org/2021/argentina-denegri-google-right-forget/) and the [Right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten)

Right for individuals to "determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically stigmatized as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past"

"By changing what we were, you change what we are and what we are going to be."
