"I struggled with this significantly in high school. I had the pleasure of working with some absolutely wonderful people. We debated together and against each other; ran conferences and events; did community service. I’d constantly rave about how insane, out of the world, and unbelievable they were. It was constant and nagging. It seeped into my personality."
