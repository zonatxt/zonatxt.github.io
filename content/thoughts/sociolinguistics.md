> How children learn to use their languages in socially appropriate ways that reflect their status in the community and the social context

## Variation

- Constrained variation: distribution of a variant is not random or free, there are systematic correlations with independent factors.
- Free variation: accounts for cases where some variants seem to alternate with each other without any reliable constraints in a particular context or when used by a certain speaker
- Interspeaker: variation occurs between different speakers within or across speech communities
- Intraspeaker: variation occurs between within a single speaker, but might depend on interlocutors and context (= inherent variability)
- Group differentiation: social/regional varieties index (mark) group boundaries
- Variation factors
  - Speaker-driven factors
  - Audience-driven factors
  - Task-related factors
  - Linguistic factors

## Language vs Dialect vs Accent

- Language: not mutually intelligible communication systems
- Dialect: mutually intelligible, but have differences in sentence structure ([[thoughts/syntax|syntax]]), how words are made ([[thoughts/morphology|morphology]]), or word choice (lexicon)
- Accent: mutually intelligible, only have differences in [[thoughts/phonology|phonology]] (sounds)

## Rate and Time

- Ochs (1985)
  - How are phonological registers, word order, and ergativity acquired by children learning Samoan (and how does their speech compare to adult patterns)?
    - Children use features of both registers even at one word stage, but do not show recognition of appropriate contexts until multi-word stage (2- 2.5 years), children start producing tautala lelei first and then tautala leaga
  - Ergativity acquired relatively late, appears to match a sociolinguistic norm in the community
- Types of time
  - Real Time: chronological time based on year
  - Apparent Time: an estimate of time based on speaker age or date of birth
  - When we look at a speaker age as a proxy for time, we must make assumptions what things are stable in language and at what ages.
