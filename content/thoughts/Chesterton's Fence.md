> "Don't ever take a fence down until you truly know the reason why it was put up" -- G.K. Chesterton

The principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood.

The same reason why we should look at [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md) and _why_ words with historical [context](thoughts/context.md) came to be (e.g. [new words](posts/new-words.md))

> "Before proposing new words, examine the beliefs and practices that we—and “they”—know perfectly well how to speak about." [Source: On Language Games by _Jon Baskin_](https://thepointmag.com/letter/on-language-games/)
