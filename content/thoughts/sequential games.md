Represented with a game tree consisting of nodes (representing choices by players) and branches
(representing different options)

A player has perfect information if their information set has just one node (e.g., chess); imperfect if more than one (e.g., silent auction where you donâ€™t know the other bids)

Two sequential games are equivalent if they have the same game tree.
