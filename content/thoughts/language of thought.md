Can we use [[thoughts/language|language]] as the method of querying memory?

## Language of thought hypothesis

Proposes thinking occurs in a mental language called mentalese.

[[thoughts/computability|Computations]] occur in a classical way (over symbols in mentalese). However, [[thoughts/neural networks|neural networks]] or [connectionist networks](thoughts/connectionist%20networks.md) challenges any argument for mentalese (as they don't fall under the [[thoughts/GOFAI|GOFAI]]/classical computation category)
