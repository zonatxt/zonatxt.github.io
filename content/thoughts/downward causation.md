In hierarchical systems, downward [[thoughts/causality|causation]] implies that higher, more abstract, levels of a system can influence lower level parts of the system.

One example of this is [telerobotics](thoughts/telerobotics.md), where we have 'higher-level' mental thoughts that coincide with lower level atomic and physical actions (i.e. muscles moving to get us to the fridge)
