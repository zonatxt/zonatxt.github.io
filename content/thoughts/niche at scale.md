"Tokyo, a city where a number of unusual stores exist: Stores that only sell vinyl records from the 1970s, or that only sell whisky from the 1980s.

Put those stores in a Des Moines suburb and they will obviously fail. But in Tokyo, where 20 to 30 million people can reach the city by train, there are likely to be a few thousand people who love 1970s albums or 1980s whiskey.

The internet is Tokyo." ([Source](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/small-business-ideas-startup-ideas-start-a-business-entrepreneur-mark-cuban-how-to-decide-which-side-hustle-to-start.html))
