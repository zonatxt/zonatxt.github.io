_Distributed Algorithmic Mechanism Design: Recent Results and Future Directions_. Joan Feigenbaum and Scott Shenker

Mechanism design asks how one can design systems so that agents’ selfish behavior results in the desired system-wide goals (similar to [[thoughts/incentives|incentive]] design and [[thoughts/economics]])

The mechanism designer’s task is to find a formula for the payments that causes agents to be no worse off by revealing their true costs than they would be by lying about their costs

Mechanisms in which agents are asked to directly reveal their [[thoughts/utility|utility]] functions are call direct mechanisms

A _dominant strategy_ is one where agents only choose strategies that regardless of how other agents play, never result in lower payoffs than any other strategy.

See: [[thoughts/game theory]], [[thoughts/economics]]
