Games are interesting when the underlying rules are simple (see: [[thoughts/Gall's law|Gall's Law]], low [[thoughts/complexity|Kolmogorov Complexity]]) but exhibit complex behaviour.

The more I think about it the more I think I eventually want to build games. All of my [[thoughts/peer-to-peer|p2p]] infrastructure work now is to build up the tools possible to explore that space of potential games. Games as explorations in [[thoughts/interaction design|interaction design]].
