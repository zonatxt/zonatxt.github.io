## 50s and 60s

People in 50s and 60s were protesting because they were worried about being turned into information and data

Two distinct movements, both which are anti-bureaucracy, anti-big tech, anti-mass culture)

- New Left: saw political organizing as the site of social change
- New Communalists: saw internal consciousness and the mind as the site of social change

Why were the 50's kids so enamoured with technology?

### Where is todays counterculture

- Not the left, but actually the right
- Concern is not big data and ML but with corporations and states
- Place of rebellion is not at the data level but at the institution and union level (in big corporations) + legal level (ex: protection of Uber drivers)
- There are bodies and factories and server farms â†’ lets not forget the basis of our abstractions
