How are parties (human and non-human) held accountable for their actions?

Reparations and reconciliation can only occur after both parties have acknowledged it. How does this work if one party '[ghosts](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/557744ffe4b013bae3b7af63/t/557f2d6ce4b029eb4288a2f8/1434398060958/)' or otherwise leaves the conversation? This is especially prevalent in online/[[thoughts/pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] interactions.

How do we keep people accountable in [digital spaces](thoughts/digital%20commons.md) and [virtual worlds](thoughts/virtual%20worlds.md)? Is it better to create better tools to help users manage digital boundaries or to shift the responsibility to the platforms? Do we do [moderation](thoughts/Moderation.md) at the [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) level?

## Scaling emotional labour

Also note that the emotional labour that goes into holding a group accountable goes up in a democratic setting when more people are involved (see also: [group limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md)). Is there a point where it is almost always better to have an authoritarian/impersonal third party? (e.g. the state and the law)
