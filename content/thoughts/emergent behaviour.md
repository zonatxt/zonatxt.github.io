How complex behaviour can arise out of seemingly simple rules? Is there anything special that causes emergent behaviour?

We see examples like

- Ant simulations
- Mold simulations
- [Community](/thoughts/communities) dynamics

Interesting to think about in context of single agents in multi-agent systems. How does [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md) arise? Is it just because of the rules itself (a [reductionist](thoughts/Reductionism.md) approach) or is there something larger at play?

[Gall's law](thoughts/Gall's%20law.md): simple alphabets produce behaviors. Even simple rules like Conway's game of life can be Turing Complete!

## Emergentism

> Once a certain level of complexity is reached, there is a kind of qualitative leap where completely new sorts of physical laws can “emerge”—ones that are premised on, but cannot be reduced to, what came before

- In this way, the laws of chemistry can be said to be emergent from physics: the laws of chemistry presuppose the laws of physics, but can’t simply be reduced to them.
- In the same way, the laws of biology emerge from chemistry: one obviously needs to understand the chemical components of a fish to understand how it swims, but chemical components will never provide a full explanation.
- In the same way, the human mind can be said to be emergent from the cells that make it up.

[[thoughts/LLMs]] seem to exhibit this sort of behaviour.

## Combination Problem

How do microlevel experiences combine to form macrolevel ones?

"Take a sentence of a dozen words, and take twelve men and tell to each one word. Then stand the men in a row or jam them in a bunch, and let each think of his word as intently as he will; nowhere will there be a consciousness of the whole sentence"

### [Panpsychist](thoughts/Panpsychism.md) response

Mental properties belong only to genuine individuals, not to mere aggregates

Then, what is the boundary of the genuine individual? This is a problem of embodiment. To be a genuine individual is not simply to be a particular (as opposed to a conglomerate or universal) but also a system that has some kind of bounded organizational unity through [autopoiesis](thoughts/autopoiesis.md) -- this is a body

Their own emergence problem: how do genuine individuals emerge from particular that aren't individuals/subjects of experience? It doesn't solve the problem of accounting for the place of consciousness in nature, it just relocates it

Mesmerizing video by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) on [how complex (and beautiful) behaviour can arise out of simple rules.](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md) I've been wanting to get into experimenting with shaders and [[thoughts/computer graphics|graphics]] stuff and this _might_ just be the slight nudge I needed.
