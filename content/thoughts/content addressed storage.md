> If I identify the book by its content, saying "Check out the book called _Why Information Grows_ by CÃ©sar Hidalgo. The ISBN is 0465048994.", you will be able to get any copy of the book from any source and know that you're reading the information I recommended.

> By contrast, if I used location-addressing to identify the book, I would have to point to a location, saying something like "Go to the news stand at Market & 15th in Philadelphia and ask for the thing 16 inches from the south end of the third shelf on the east wall"

Content-addressed storage or abbreviated CAS, is a way to store information so it can be retrieved based on its content, not its location.

Location-addressed: e.g. [[thoughts/HTTP]], you lookup a content by its location (URI). Whoever controls the location controls the content. This location-addressed approach forces us all to pretend that the data are in only one location (even if multiple people have copies of it!)

Content-addressed: using the content's cryptographic hash to identify it. These links are permanent because the cryptographic hash for a piece of content never changes.

## Immutable Objects, Mutable References

The [[thoughts/Merkle-DAG|Merkle-DAG]], immutable content-addressed objects, and mutable pointers to the Merkle-DAG, instantiate a dichotomy present in many successful distributed systems

[[thoughts/IPFS|IPFS]] accomplishes this by creating a separate prefix `/ipns/<NodeID>` ofr mutable paths. One can prove ownership because only the owner of the private key of `NodeID` can publish to it

## Literary Machines

In Ted Nelson's 1981 Literary Machines, he imagined a universally addressed public repository system

> In the computer world this will change, especially if -- as I foresee -- there will be one great repository and everything will be equally accessible. This means that "different" articles and books will more likely be _different versions of the same work,_ and _different pathways through it for different readers_

The system promotes the coexistence and resolution of many viewpoints, through the sharing of private documents and comments, and the publication of [[thoughts/hypertext]] complexes whose interrelationships remain orderly.
