Conceptual models are explanations (usually highly simplified) of how something works. These can be the [desktop metaphor](thoughts/desktop%20metaphor.md) where files, folders, and icons help represent the model of data on the hard drive. We are concerned with mentally held conceptual models -- mental models.

Often times the designer's conceptual model, the system image (how it manifests in reality), and the user's conceptual model are not aligned.
