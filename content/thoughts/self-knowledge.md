## Reflexivity

Self-illumination/reflexivity

- Every conscious experience is directly revealed to itself.
- "In seeing blue, you experience [[thoughts/seeing|seeing]]"
- Problems: Reflexivity as a concept is weird though
  - "A knife cannot cut itself, an acrobat canâ€™t stand on their own shoulders."
  - "How can one and the same awareness be both of an object/content and of itself?"

## Reflectivity

Other-illumination/reflectivity

- For a state to be a conscious state is for it to be the object of a higher-order mental state (an inner perception or inner thought).
- "I see blue, I'm aware that I see blue"
- Problems: how could two states that are nonconscious in themselves come together and make one of them conscious?
  - Curious how this applies to [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)
  - By having a higher layer that enables the reference of a lower layer, this is essentially a two-way recursive relation that opens the door to much more [[thoughts/composable|composable]] and perhaps complex behaviour

Nagarjana's Argument

- Infinite regress, you cannot use a fact to establish itself
- Summarized in terms of reflectivity
  Opponents Argument
- Can use recursive definition, a fact can have a 'base case'
