> To fall in love with the world isn't to ignore or overlook suffering, both human and otherwise. For me anyway, to fall in love with the world is to look up at the night sky and feel you mind swim before the beauty and the distance of the stars. It is to hold your children while they cry, to watch as the sycamore trees leaf out in June... We all know how loving ends. But I want to fall in love with the world anyway, to let it crack me open. I want to feel what there is to feel while I am here.

So much of what actually changes in human life isn't driven by events, but instead by processes, which often aren't considered news.

"In the alley, there is a bright pink flower peeking out through the asphalt. A) it looks like futility B) it looks like hope"

"Third things are essential to marriages, objects or practices or habits or arts or institutions or games or human beings that provide a site of joint rapture or contentment. Each member of a couple is separate; the two come together in double attention"

"The pleasure isn't owning the person. The pleasure is this. Having another contender in the room with you"

"Our obsessive desire to _make_ and _have_ and _do_ and _say_ and _go_ and _get_ -- six of the seven most common verbs in English -- may ultimately steal away our ability to _be_, the most common verb in English."
