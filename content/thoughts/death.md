> Death is thus separation from everything that gives our life form. It is the loss of everything that we hold dear... the finality of it, is harrowing

Conceptions of death in [The Upanisads](thoughts/The%20Upanisads.md) and [Epicurueanism](thoughts/Epicurueanism.md)

## Death in contemporary terms[^1]

1. State of being dead
2. The momentary event of dying
   1. Ending of the dying process (denouement death): separates the dying process from the subsequent disintegration
   2. Point when extinction is assured (threshold death): irreversable loss of [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md)/personhood/functioning
      1. Medical Criteria
         1. Irreversible cessation of circulatory-respiratory function (traditionally)
         2. Irreversible cessation of the functioning of the entire brain, including the brain stem (the modern biomedical criterion)
         3. Irreversible cessation of the functioning of the cerebral cortex (newer controversial idea that the cortex is the locus of consciousness)
   3. Loss of integrated functioning (integration death)
3. The process of dissolution (dying)

Problem with these is that we don't know exactly when the experiences happen in relation to the time-course of the near death experience

- Reports only give us the patient's subjective representation of time, not the objective time when the experience was actually happening
- Have virtually no direct evidence about what states of the brain are associated with NDEs
