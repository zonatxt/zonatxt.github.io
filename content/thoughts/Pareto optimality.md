If there is no profile where one player’s payoff is better but no player’s payoff is worse. Pareto optimality is a criterion of ‘group [[thoughts/rationality]]’, not a criterion for individual rationality (see: [[thoughts/Nash equilibrium]])

Usually only applicable for [[thoughts/positive sum]] games
