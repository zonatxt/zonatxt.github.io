Is anything ever new? Is everything derivative

Lavoisier once said: "Rien ne se perd, rien ne se crée, tout se transforme" — meaning "Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed." (when applied to fundamental physics)

Ideas are mostly recombination, does this imply that everything comes from one 'original' idea?
