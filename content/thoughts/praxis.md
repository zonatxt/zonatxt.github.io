The process in which ideas and theories are realized or embodied as action.

The argument is that all professions are mixtures of theory and practice. If a job is so simple that it is just a series of steps to carry out (algorithmic), then it is not a profession (counterpoint: can everything be reduced into [[thoughts/computability|algorithmic]] steps? How concrete do the steps need to be?).

Bates distinguishes between discipline (theory) and profession (practice).
