Mass media communications theory

- Origins in social psychology
- Gatekeeper makes decisions about what should be passed on and to whom
- A form of social control

## Digital gate keeping

- Platforms gate keep by managing [information](thoughts/information.md) flows in many different ways
- Non-human agents participate through algorithmic filtering (e.g. upvoting content)
- See centralization of [Internet](thoughts/Internet.md) through search

## Differences from [censorship](thoughts/censorship.md)

- Censorship is all about blocking
- Gate keeping is more about access and quality control

## Personalization as a form of gatekeeping

- Information flow and filtering is based on individual and/or group profiles
- Bozdag (2013): personalization leads to more [bias](thoughts/bias.md) rather than less
- Cass Sunstein: "information cocoons"
- Serves a sort of invisible auto propaganda, indoctrinating us with our own ideas, amplifying our desire for things that are familiar
