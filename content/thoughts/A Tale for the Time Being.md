The amount of depth to the story being slowly unravelled over time is astounding; it keeps me on edge and always wanting to read more. Very similar in pacing/writing to [[thoughts/Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow]]

## On Time

I think this book has really got me thinking about [[thoughts/time]] and time differences. Not just in absolute offsets in terms of like time zones, but how different people experience life at differing speeds depending on their context, environment, etc.

To me, it feels like empathy is really just emotional time dilation and temporarily moving at their pace of live if only for a brief moment. The MƒÅori word for autism is takiwatanga: "in his/her own time and space" There is no 'cognitive' slowness, they are rather living at their own pace.
