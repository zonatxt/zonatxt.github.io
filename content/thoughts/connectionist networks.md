## Architecture

- A large number of units which are connected to others (connectionism) and the connections have different strengths (weights)
- Units are arranged in layers
- Computation happens in parallel

## Representation

- Like in a classical [[thoughts/GOFAI|GOFAI system]], [representations](/thoughts/representation) are assigned to connectionist networks by the people who build them
- There are two types of connectionist representation
  1.  localist → each unit is assigned a feature as a whole that represents
  2.  distributed → state of the network as a whole represents something
      - often claimed to be one of the distinctive features of connectionism
      - connectionist networks is sometimes called parallel distributed processing (PDP)
- Can be trained to learn and resembles the structure of the brain much more closely than any classical computer
