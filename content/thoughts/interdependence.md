- Dependent Existence: for a flower to exist and for us to have experienced it requires the existence of many others. The gardener, the sun, the water, the minerals, the soil.
  - In cognitive science, concept of [connectionist representation](thoughts/representation.md)
  - In [emergent systems](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md), there is no 'conductor' there is only a symphony that interdepend on each other
- Independent Existence: a separate existence. A flower cannot be by herself or have a self-nature (svabhāva).
