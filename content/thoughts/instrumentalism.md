Reminiscent of the [move fast and break things](thoughts/move%20fast%20and%20break%20things.md) Silicon Valley ethic.

"This tendency to instrumentalize, or to treat something as a means or resource for achieving some end goal, shows up in the personal lives of many technologists. Many types of “fun” are made [[thoughts/telic action|telic]])."

> _“All that was good becomes data. All that was beautiful is now efficient.”_ (_Jacques Ellul, in The Technological Society_)

An inherent [quantization](thoughts/quantization.md) and optimization of everything. Prevalent in [recommendation systems](thoughts/recommendation%20system.md) where poor proxies are often the target of optimization that ignores the humans under them (e.g. engagement metrics rather than satisfaction and wellbeing). [Goodhart's Law](thoughts/Goodhart's%20Law.md)

"Creation of spaces of local abundance (as opposed to, say, a space like YCombinator, where the space is meant to help you reach a specific external outcome under time-bounded pressure) where technologists can [play](thoughts/play.md) with ideas and think freely, similar to parks and urban forests in a bustling city"

> Decide carefully what to pay [[thoughts/attention]] to out of an infinity of possible ends to apply your time and resources, and what worlds you wish to bring about. This is a call to build a beautiful and deeply good future.
