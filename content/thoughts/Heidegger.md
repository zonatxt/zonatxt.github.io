## Dasein

Literally means 'Being-there'. Through the use of this expression, Heidegger calls to attention the fact that a human cannot exist or be taken into account without existing in [context](thoughts/context.md) of a world with other things -- "to be human is to be fixed, embedded, and immersed in the physical, literal, tangible day to day world"

## Near-ness

Heidegger observes that because of technology, “all distances in time and space are shrinking” and “yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance.”

## Context

Values are just meaningless facts (hammer is for hammering). It leaves out information defining the _relation_ of hammers to nails and the rest of the environment (readiness-to-hand)
