## A formal definition

1. Me (self-as-object)
   1. Some feature is the object of my awareness
   2. I recognize this feature as mine or ascribe it to myself
2. I (self-as-subject)
   1. I experience myself as subject of perception/cognition/emotion
   2. Body anchored

Valid in dreams, but also [games](thoughts/games.md)?

## Autoscopic Phenomena

- Autoscopic Hallucination: you see a double of yourself but do not feel like you have ownership or agnecy over it
- Heautoscopy: visual perspective switches back and forth between yourself and double and you feel ownership of both
- Out-of-body experience: you identify the body seen from the outside as yours but have no feeling of agency for it. Direct electrical stimulation at the temporoparietal junction induces out-of-body experiences
