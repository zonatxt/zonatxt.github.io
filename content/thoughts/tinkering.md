## Playful Software

[Source](https://woolgather.sh/issue/2)

> This early discovery-by-play keeps recurring, in history and across disciplines. Richard Feynman talks about [tinkering with radios as a kid](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/misc/feynman.pdf). James Cameron, J.J. Abrams, Martin Scorsese, and countless other filmmakers [credit Super 8](https://slate.com/culture/2011/06/j-j-abrams-super-8-how-kodak-s-low-cost-super-8-film-influenced-a-generation-of-filmmakers.html) with their starts.

Tinkerability and accessibility. As Feynman notes, “Radio circuits were much easier to understand in those days because everything was out in the open.” _The Slate_ article on Super 8 notes how cheap the film was, “You didn't have to worry about experimenting with it.” These are the preconditions to play.

**But the inconvenient fact of technological progress is that it inherently trends toward [[thoughts/complexity|complexity]] and obfuscation**... Similarly, if I were a kid today, there's no way I could self-teach HTML by inspecting source.

Playful software that let people experiment with their own spaces and forms of expression are a precondition to a more enlivening internet
