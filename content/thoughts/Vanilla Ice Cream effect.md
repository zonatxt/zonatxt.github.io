## Coordination Headwind

[Source: How Organizations are like Slime Molds by _Alex Komoroske_](https://komoroske.com/slime-mold/)

In small orgs, individuals matter a lot, but when the org gets larger the system (structure + dynamics) dominate. [Consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) is especially difficult in larger groups.

Bottom-up orgs (slime mold model)

- unpredictable
- uncontrollable (can influence via incentives)
- individual autonomy
- fluid
- messy
- resilient
- exploratory

Top-down orgs (military model)

- predictable
- controllable
- cog in the machine
- structured
- efficient
- fragile
- exploitative
