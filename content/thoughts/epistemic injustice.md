from _Epistemic Injustice_ by Miranda Fricker

Related to social [power](thoughts/power.md)

Types of epistemic injustice:

1. [Testimonial](thoughts/testimony.md) Injustice: giving a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word for no other reason other than identity prejudice in a way that harms the speaker
2. [Hermeneutical Injustice](thoughts/hermeneutical%20injustice.md): the injustice of having some significant area of one's social experience obscured from collective understanding owing to hermeneutical marginalization

Learning new epistemic resources is difficult for multiple reasons

1. Lack of [trust](thoughts/trust.md) between groups
2. Dominantly situated knower being unwilling to confront destabilizing truths
3. Reluctance or inability of dominant group to recognize the value of the epistemic resources they're being taught
