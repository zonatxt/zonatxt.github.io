How do we bridge objective description and subjective experience (qualia)? Is [[thoughts/consciousness]] explainable in terms of brain processes?

What gives rise to consciousness (rel: [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)), first-person experiences, and a sense of [[thoughts/the Self|self]]? Do inanimate and non-human intelligences have personal experiences?

Chalmers

- Certain phenomena are functionally definable -- explanation of them requires only the explanation of the relevant functions and the mechanisms that implement them (e.g. hereditary passing of genes and DNA)
- Consciousness is _not_ functionally definable
  - Defining information discrimination, integration, and reporting does not fully explain consciousness

## Explanatory Gap

There is no cognitive function such that we can say in advance that explanation of that function will automatically explain subjective experience
