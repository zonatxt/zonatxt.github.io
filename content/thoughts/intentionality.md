Intentionality is the ability to be _about_ something.

## Derived Intentionality

Intentionality is derived. The same reason why computer-generated art or AI-assisted [[thoughts/writing|writing]] would not be considered 'novel' or 'intelligent'. The intentionality of the user is what gets injected. These tool-assisted generation of artifacts are no more different than fancier pens and paint brushes.

[Chinese room argument](thoughts/Chinese%20room%20argument.md) example tries to show that even programming something with intentionality (a person) with a format program, that formal program carries no additional intentionality

How does intention change with time? Are my intentions in the past just as valid as my current intentions?

- Smart contracts and blockchains try to permanently embed and codify intentionality
- But, intentionality doesn't mean you can't change though. People aren't permanent, thoughts aren't permanent. Why should we try to make them so? (see: [[posts/me-myselves-and-i|meditation on change of self]])

## Dennet

Intentionality is based off of repeated behaviour rather than internal mechanisms. This accepts [Brentano](thoughts/Brentano's%20Thesis.md)'s definition of the mental, but proposed [[thoughts/Materialism|materialist]] way to view intentionality (and intelligence)

1.  Behaviour should be understood not in isolation but in [[thoughts/context]] and as part of a consistent pattern of behaviour (holism)
2.  A consistent pattern of behaviour in context can be construed as [[thoughts/rationality|rational]] (interpretation)

### Rabbit example

We infer that a rabbit can tell a fox from another rabbit, always wanting to get away from the one but not the other

Thus, on a given occasion, we attribute to the rabbit intentional states (beliefs and desires) about a particular fox, on the basis not only of its current behaviour but also of the pattern in its behaviour over time.
