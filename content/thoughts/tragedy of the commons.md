> The more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. --[Scott Moore](https://scott.mirror.xyz/7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw)

A government only has interest in [funding](thoughts/funding.md) its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure. Very prevalent in [open-source](posts/paid-open-source.md), some of the most used software in the world often goes unpaid and unfunded.

Commons in the modern economic context is any open-access and unregulated resource (e.g. atmosphere, ocean, rivers, etc.)

> How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation?

Would be solved if people acted according [[thoughts/Kant]]'s Categorical Imperative

## Without Tragedy

Elinor Ostrom defines 7 requirements to govern a commons without tragedy:

- Clear boundaries (private)
- Managed by locals
- Community makes its own rules
- Community can monitor behavior
- Graduated sanctions for those who violate community rules
- Cheap, accessible means of conflict resolution
- Self-determination

In a small community, everybody knows everybody, and can keep track of what they do. This makes small groupsÂ [[thoughts/game theory|iterated games]] which rewards trust and penalizes sociopathic behaviour
