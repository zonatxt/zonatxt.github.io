## Mediums versus Tools

Linus Lee on [Browsers as Tools of Thought](https://thesephist.com/posts/browser/)

> A tool is something that takes an existing workflow, and makes it more efficient. A nail is an efficient way of holding pieces of wood together; a to-do app is an efficient way of remembering your responsibilities.

**The best mediums are instead collections of generic, multi-purpose *components* that mesh together well**
