Ethics is the rational systematic analysis of [[thoughts/morality]].

Ethics is focused on the voluntary, moral choices. Ethics is _not_ concerned about involuntary choices or choices outside the moral realm.

Workable ethical theory: produces explanations that aim to be persuasive to a skeptical, yet open-minded audience about what is "right" or "wrong"

Especially important for technologists to grapple with as common wisdom may not exist for novel situations brought about by new technologies (see: [[thoughts/Collingridge dilemma|Collingridge Dillemma]])

## 4 Unworkable Ethical Theories

1. Subjective Relativism: "who are you to criticise my values"
   - There's no universal standard of right or wrong, each individual must decide for themselves
   - _Everything_ is equally valid, not that "I can see how people can arrive at different conclusions"
2. Cultural Relativism: "who are you to criticise my culture's values"
   - Moral actions are based on a culture's actual moral guidelines
     - Traditions develop because they meet a need, but once a tradition has been established, people behave in a certain way because it’s what they’re supposed to do, not because they understand the rationality deeply embedded within the tradition.
   - It is presumptuous to judge another culture's values
3. Divine Command Theory: "stealing is wrong because the Bible says so"
   - We should use holy books (or any sort of appeal to authority) as guides for moral decision making
   - Only effective to those who already believe in the same beliefs as us
   - See also [[thoughts/religious authority|appeals to religious authority]]
4. Ethical Egoism
   - People's self-interest is their only ethical obligation
   - What's good for the market (modelled by selfish agents) is good for society
   - However, does not respect the ethical point of view
     - The ethical point of view is the understanding that other people and their core values are also worthy of respect
