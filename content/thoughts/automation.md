[Source: What Tech Futurists Get Wrong About Human Autonomy by _Divya Siddarth and Kelsi Nabben_](https://www.noemamag.com/ai-blockchain-human-autonomy-future/)

[AI systems](posts/agi.md) and [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md) are both means to achieve the same "underlying desire: to implicitly or explicitly abstract away human fallibility in service of a fully automated vision of perfection."

AI focuses on autonomy of **outcome**, blockchain focuses on autonomy of **process**.

Prevalent in [post-work society thinking](posts/play.md), especially one of a [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md) sum, post-scarcity world.

> "However, the link between individual autonomy and the collective good has always been pernicious â€” and nowhere more so than in the visions of technology that promise to give us both in unparalleled measure."

Instead, we need to push not for technological **determinism** but for technological **[[thoughts/plurality|pluralism]]**.
