> New technology will save us!!

Technosolutionism in governing from just a quantized dashboard where the _people responsible for making the decisions are so abstracted away from the actual problems that they need to solve_

> â€¦the tendency of jobs to be adapted to tools, rather than adapting tools to jobs. If one has a hammer one tends to look for nails, and if one has a computer with a storage capacity, but no feelings, one is more likely to concern oneself with remembering and with problem solving than with loving and hating. (Silvan Tomkins, founder of affect theory)

"... where we are wholly dependent on a handful of extraordinarily gifted entrepreneurs to lead us out of the dark ages. This is a myth."

First, it contains a somewhat masked normative assumption that "technology adoption" is always a good thing.
