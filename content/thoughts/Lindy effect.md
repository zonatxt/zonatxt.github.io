[Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect): future life expectancy of a bit of technology is proportional to its current age (i.e. the longer something has survived, the more likely it is to have a longer remaining life expectancy).

Longevity implies a resistance to change, obsolescence or competition and greater odds of continued existence into the future.

Many traditional materials have the attractive property that they _look bad before they act bad_ and, furthermore, _the problems with traditional materials are well understood_.
