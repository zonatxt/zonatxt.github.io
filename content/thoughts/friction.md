## Bring back Friction on the [Internet](thoughts/Internet.md)

[Source: The case for slowing everything down a bit by _Ezra Klein_](https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/11/19/18101274/google-alphabet-facebook-twitter-addiction-speed)

The reduction of friction on the web is a business strategy. "Less friction means more time spent, more ads seen, more sales made. Tech companies lose customers during login screens and security verification, and as a result of slow load times. The country’s top computer science talent is paid billions of dollars to further reduce the milliseconds of delay separating our desires and their fulfillment."

“The philosophy of the Internet has assumed that friction is always part of the problem,” writes Kosslyn. But look around. The problem now isn’t too much friction; it’s too little. “It’s time,” he says, “to bring friction back.”

Friction creates space in the system where judgment can intercede, where second thoughts can be had, where decisions can be made.

[[thoughts/writing|Writing]], by contrast, is full of friction. It’s hard and slow, and the words on the page fall short of the music and clarity I imagined they’d have. But it is, in the end, rewarding. It’s where I have at least a chance to create something worth creating. The work is worth it.
