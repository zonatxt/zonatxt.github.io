> Geocaching meets Pokemon Go for the Web

Summarized from their [retrospective here](http://pmog.com/).

The premise of The Nethernet came from the fact that internet users spend a large portion of their time multitasking, browsing information, or contacting other people online. The Nethernet aimed to classify and allocate an individual’s internet use and then utilize the gathered information in a unique and playful manner.

Making the casual act of [[thoughts/information retrieval]] fun and playful

The Nethernet was originally an in-browser toolbar that compensated users as they browsed the World Wide Web. The game evolved as a HUD overlay in the Firefox web browser.
