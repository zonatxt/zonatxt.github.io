Close correspondence between rights and duties. If one has a right, others have a duty not to take that right away. For example, moral obligation to not take away the right to life of another.

Types of rights:

- A negative right is a right that another can guarantee by leaving you alone to exercise your right. For example, the right of free expression. In order for you to have that right, all others have to do is not interfere with you when you express yourself.
- A positive right is a right that obligates others to do something on your behalf. The right to a free education is a positive right
- An absolute right is on that is guaranteed without exception
- A limited right is one that may be restricted based on the circumstances
