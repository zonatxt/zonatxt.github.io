## Hypertext

[Source: Hypertext Montage by _Gordon Brander_](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/hypertext-montage)

> When we talk together, we flatten our N-dimensional thoughts into 1D linear narratives, in order to fit them through the 1D bottleneck of words. When we draw or sketch, we flatten our N-dimensional thoughts into 2D images in order to fit them through the 2D bottleneck of sight.

What is the shape of [networked-thought](posts/networked-thought.md)?

## Interpretation

Does moving closer to real-time communication mean less interpretation is required? Less expressive mediums like text mean that a lot of the emotion and meaning is left up to the reader to interpret and guess at. As we move to higher bandwidth mediums (e.g. calls and video), is there less room to interpret?

What does this mean for art which inherently requires interpretation? Will we ever get to a communication medium so direct (e.g. mind-to-mind) that it doesn't require interpretation? What about [qualia](thoughts/qualia.md) and the subjective human experience?
