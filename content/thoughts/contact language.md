## Digital Contact Languages

Contact Language: broadly speaking, this [[thoughts/language|language]] served to facilitate collaboration across the groups it interconnected.

The rise of the Kindle points out that even the concept of a link—a “uniform resource locator,” or URL—is under great stress. Since Kindle books don’t live on the World Wide Web, there’s no URL pointing to a particular page or passage of them. The same goes for content within any number of mobile apps, leaving people to trade screenshots—or, as _The Atlantic_’s Kaitlyn Tiffany [put it](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/screenshots-gremlins-internet/619062/), “the gremlins of the internet”—as a way of conveying content.
