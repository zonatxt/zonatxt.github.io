> A way of mapping human readable names to cryptographically secure names

[Petnames](http://www.erights.org/elib/capability/pnml.html) are potentially a method of achieving all 3 properties of [[thoughts/Zooko's Triangle]] by having "names with each of the three pairs of properties, and [building] a naming system involving several of these kinds of names, in order to make use of all three properties."

We are already familiar with this concept actually: the contact list on your phone! Each contact in your phone doesn't actually represent that person, but rather your _relationship_ with that person. `John (neighbour)` could be `Dad` in someone else's phone, even though they refer to the same physical person.

Supposes that we have three names:

1. Keys (global and unique): no one has the same key as you
2. Petnames (unique and memorable): specific to a _relationship_ between two entities
3. Nicknames (global and memorable): self-proclaimed

Then, keys and petnames are interchangeable with each other. Nicknames are suggestions by users for petnames that others can set for them.

Maybe another version of [[thoughts/Arrow's Impossibility Theorem]]?
