What does deletion mean when copying bytes is cheap and can happen without consent anywhere along the line. A conjecture is that deletion can _only_ exist in non-[[thoughts/Byzantine Faults|byzantine]] environments. The more observers there are the harder it is to convince everyone to delete/forget it.

Does deletion ever _actually_ occur? How does this reconcile with theories like conservation of information? (erase vs whiteout)

## Deletion trilemma

Any implementation of deletion in a p2p context cannot have all of:

2. Actual deletion
3. Fast/efficient
