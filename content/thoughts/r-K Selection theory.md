> In ecology, r/K selection theory relates to the selection of combinations of traits in an organism that trade off between quantity and quality of offspring

| r-selected                     | K-selected                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| many offspring, low investment | few offspring, high investment |
| thrive in unstable habitats    | thrive in stable habitats      |

## r-selection

_r_-selected species are those that emphasize high growth rates, typically exploit less-crowded ecological niches, and produce many offspring, each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood

Examples include dandelions, insects, rodents, etc.

## K-selection

_K_-selected species display traits associated with living at densities close to carrying capacity and typically are strong competitors in such crowded niches, that [invest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_investment "Parental investment") more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood

Examples include elephants, humans, whales, etc.
