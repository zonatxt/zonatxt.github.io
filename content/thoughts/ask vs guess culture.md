_phrasing from [Jasmine](https://jasminew.me/)_

In a guess culture, there is a high social cost in asking for things. Individuals often _guess_ at the reaction of the other in order to mitigate potential social cost (e.g. will not ask for things if it could be seen as out of place). They tend to ask for things less with the assumption that the other will most likely accept

On the other hand, ask culture implies a social cost in asking for things. As a result, individuals will just ask and expect to be rejected more often, generally more forward
