An act is rational (roughly) if it is most likely to maximize satisfaction of the agentâ€™s preferences or [[thoughts/utility|utility]].

**Bounded rationality:** the choices that people make attempt to maximize benefit and minimize cost are imperfect: humans have a hard time precisely estimating benefit and cost and thus use imperfect heuristics to pick the most promising choices. (see: [[thoughts/Decisions under risk]])

Interesting argumental ties to [effective altruism](thoughts/effective%20altruism.md), especially w.r.t. optimizing for benefit and minimizing cost.
